Simple Financial calculator for assignments

This program allows the user access to two different calculators; an investment calculator and a home-loan calculator.

The user is able to choose which calculation they want from a menu, and the relevant calculations are then applied.

The user input is not effected by mixing lower and upper case, so the user is free to enter their input however they like.

If the user selects ‘investment’,the following will happen.

● Ask the user to input:
● The amount of money that they are depositing.
● The interest rate (as a percentage).
● The number of years they plan on investing for.
● Whether they want “simple”or “compound” interest.

If the user selects ‘bond’:
● Ask the user to input:
● The present value of the house. 
● The interest rate.
● The number of months they plan to take to repay the
bond. 

The program then calculates how much money the user will repay every month.
